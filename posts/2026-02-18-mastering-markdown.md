Markdown has become the lingua franca of technical writing. From README files to blog posts, documentation to notes, it's everywhere. Let's master it together.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown offers the perfect balance between simplicity and expressiveness. You can write it in any text editor, it's human-readable even without rendering, and it converts beautifully to HTML.

## Essential Syntax

### Headings

Use `#` symbols to create headings. One `#` for H1, two `##` for H2, and so on up to six levels.

### Emphasis

- *Italic* with single asterisks: `*italic*`
- **Bold** with double asterisks: `**bold**`
- ***Bold italic*** with triple: `***bold italic***`
- ~~Strikethrough~~ with tildes: `~~strikethrough~~`

### Lists

Unordered lists use `-`, `*`, or `+`:

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

Ordered lists use numbers:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Code

Inline code uses single backticks: `const x = 42`

Code blocks use triple backticks with an optional language:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### Links and Images

Links: `[text](url)`
Images: `![alt text](url)`

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting important information or citing sources.

### Tables

| Feature | Markdown | HTML |
|---------|----------|------|
| Headers | `#` | `<h1>` |
| Bold | `**text**` | `<strong>` |
| Links | `[text](url)` | `<a>` |
